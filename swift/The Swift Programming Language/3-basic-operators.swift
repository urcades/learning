/*
 Assignment Operator
 */

// The assignment operator (a = b) initializes or updates the value of a with the value of b:
let b = 10
var a = 5
a = b

// If the right side of the assignment is a tuple with multiple values,
// its elements can be decomposed into multiple constants or variables at once:
let (x, y) = (1, 4)

//: [Next](@next)
