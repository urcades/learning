// Getting Started

// Following along with https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/guidedtour/

// prints "Hello world!"
print("Hello world!")
//
// Code written at global scope is used as the entry point for the program, so you donâ€™t need a main() function.
// You also donâ€™t need to write semicolons at the end of every statement.

// Simple Values

// Use let to make a constant and var to make a variable.
var myVariable = 22
myVariable = 44
let myConstant = 88
// A constant or variable must have the same type as the value you want to assign to it.
// However, you donâ€™t always have to write the type explicitly.
// If the initial value doesnâ€™t provide enough information (or if there isnâ€™t an initial value),
// specify the type by writing it after the variable, separated by a colon:
let implicitInteger = 22
let implicitDouble = 22.2
let explicitDouble: Double = 22
let explicitFloat: Float = 4
// Values are never implicitly converted to another type.
// If you need to convert a value to a different type, explicitly make an instance of the desired type:
let label = "The width is "
let width = 45
let widthLabel = label + String(width)
// Thereâ€™s an even simpler way to include values in strings:
// Write the value in parentheses, and write a backslash (\) before the parentheses. For example:
let apples = 3
let oranges = 5
let appleSummary = "I have \(apples) apples."
let fruitSummary = "I have \(apples + oranges) pieces of fruit."
let myName = "Edouard"
let greetingSomeone = "Hey what's up \(myName)?"
let fpValueA: Float = 33.11
let fpValueB: Float = 44.88
let fpCalculation = "The added values are \(fpValueA + fpValueB)"
// Use three double quotation marks (""") for strings that take up multiple lines
// Indentation at the start of each quoted line is removed, as long as it matches
// the indentation of the closing quotation marks:
let quotation = """
    Even though there's whitespace to the left,
    the actual lines aren't indented.
        Except for this line.
    Double quotes (") can appear without being escaped.

    I still have \(apples + oranges) pieces of fruit.

// Create arrays and dictionaries using brackets ([]),
// and access their elements by writing the index or key in brackets.
// A comma is allowed after the last element:
var fruits = ["strawberries", "limes", "oranges"]
fruits[1] = "grapes"
var jobs = [
    "Ed": "Whatever",
    "Jenny": "Cutie Pie",
]
jobs["Whiskey"] = "Cat"
// Arrays automatically grow as you add elements:
fruits.append("olives")
print(fruits)
// You also use brackets to write an empty array or dictionary.
// For an array, write [], and for a dictionary, write [:]:
fruits = []
jobs = [:]
// If youâ€™re assigning an empty array or dictionary to a new variable,
// or another place where there isnâ€™t any type information, you need to specify the type:
let emptyArray: [String] = []
let emptyDictionary: [String: Float] = [:]

// Control Flow

// Use if and switch to make conditionals, and use
// for-in, while, and repeat-while to make loops.
// Parentheses around the condition or loop variable are optional.
// Braces around the body are required:
let individualScores = [75, 43, 103, 87, 12]
var teamScore = 0
for score in individualScores {
    // In an if statement, the conditional must be a Boolean expression
    if (score > 50) {
        teamScore += 3
    } else {
        teamScore += 1
    }
}
print(teamScore)
// You can write if or switch after the equal sign (=)
// of an assignment or after return, to choose a value based on the condition:
let scoreDecoration = if teamScore > 10 {
    "ðŸŽ‰"
} else {
    ""
}
print("Score:", teamScore, scoreDecoration)

// You can use if and let together to work with values that might be missing.
// These values are represented as optionals.
// Write a question mark (?) after the type of a value to mark the value as optional.
