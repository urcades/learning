This is a repo where I'll add random language-learning directories and other things.

> [!NOTE]
> For the most part, there will be experiments focusing on Rust, Swift, and Python in here.

> [!WARNING]
> This is really just for me to keep sketches synced between computers, I don't expect it to be intelligible by anyone besides me!
